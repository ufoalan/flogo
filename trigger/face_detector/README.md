# tibco-raspberrypi3-cameraV2
This trigger provides face detection capability to your flogo application. When the camera detect a human face, it will store the image in the given file path and the file path will be passed to next action as output parameter.

## Pre-requisite
In order to install this trigger, you have to install OpenCV and GoCV.
1. Install the RaspberryPi 3 Camera-V2. Please refer to https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera about how to connect the camera to RPi.
2. Install GoCV and OpenCV 3.3.1. Please refer to https://gocv.io/getting-started/linux/ for installation.
3. Add below lines in the end of ~/.bashrc file. The first line is to set the CGO envirnoment variables for OpenCV. The second line is to enable the driver for Raspberry PI 3 Camera V2. (Please noted that step 1 will only enable the camera. In order to allow OpenCV to interact with the camera, bcm2835-v4l2 driver is required)
	source $GOROOT/src/gocv.io/x/gocv/env.sh
	sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2	
4. Execute "source ~/.bashrc"
## Installation
